## Repository for the QUB-Perception of Human Engagement in assembly Operation Dataset
**About QUB-PHEO**
One of the core stages of efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC) is human-intention inference, enabling robots to anticipate and respond to human actions seamlessly. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based models or handcrafted heuristics, which lack adaptability to dynamic environments. In contrast, learning-based approaches leverage data-driven models to infer human intent, but their effectiveness depends on the availability of high-quality, multi-view datasets that capture rich spatial-temporal cues.
To address this, we introduce QUB-PHEO, a novel visual-based dyadic multi-view dataset designed to enhance intention inference in HRC. The dataset consists of synchronized multi-view recordings of 70 participants performing 36 distinct assembly subtasks, providing fine-grained labels for action recognition, gaze estimation, and object tracking. By enabling deep learning models to learn intent prediction from diverse viewpoints, QUB-PHEO paves the way for proactive and adaptive robotic collaboration in real-world settings.
